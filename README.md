Automatic irrigation system using soil moisture sensors. The goal is to make chip falesafe system working independently of electric network and water supply, basing soil condition and without human’s participation. \

System’s components:
1.	Controller Raspberry Pi 4 model B
2.	MCP3008, 8-channel 10-bit analog to digital converter
3.	DS3231, real-time clock
4.	Soil moisture sensors 
5.	Water tank
6.	Hoses
7.	Electric water valves
8.	Solar battery
9.	Water pump (probably)
10.	Application or site web to manage the system (second phase of project)
